= Step 6: Create Distribution

== Description

Create source and binary tarballs.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
% ./gradlew build -x test
----

Look in `fineract-war/build/distributions/` for the tarballs.

Make sure to do some sanity checks. The source tarball and the code in the release branch (at the commit with the release tag) should match.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
% cd /fineract-release-preparations
% tar -xvf path/to/apache-fineract-{revnumber}-src.tar.gz
% git clone git@github.com:apache/fineract.git
% cd fineract/
% git checkout tags/{revnumber}
% cd ..
% diff -r fineract apache-fineract-{revnumber}
----

Make sure the code compiles and tests pass on the uncompressed source. Do as much testing as you can and share what you did. Ideally you'd build code and docs and run every possible test and check, but https://github.com/apache/fineract/actions[running everything has complex dependencies, caches, and takes many hours]. It is rarely done in practice offline / local / on developer machines. But please, go ahead and run the test and doc tasks, and more! Grab a cup of coffee and run everything you can. See the various builds in `.github/workflows/` and try the same things on your own. We should all hammer on a release candidate as much as we can to see if it breaks and fix it if so. All that of course improves our final release.

Finally, inspect `apache-fineract-{revnumber}-binary.tar.gz`. Make sure the `fineract-provider-{revnumber}.jar` can be run directly, and the `fineract-provider.war` can be run with Tomcat.
